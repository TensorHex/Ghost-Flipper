# Development

Flipper Zero Firmware is written in C, with some bits and pieces written in C++ and armv7m assembly languages. An intermediate level of C knowledge is recommended for comfortable programming. C, C++, and armv7m assembly languages are supported for Flipper applications.

## Requirements

Supported development platforms:

- Windows 10+ with PowerShell and Git (x86_64)
- macOS 12+ with Command Line tools (x86_64, arm64)
- Ubuntu 20.04+ with build-essential and Git (x86_64)

FBT will take care of all the other dependencies.

## Cloning source code

Make sure you have enough space and clone the source code:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TensorHex/Ghost-Flipper.git
```

## Building

Build firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt
```

## Flashing firmware using USB

Make sure your Flipper is on, and your firmware is functioning. Connect your Flipper with a USB cable and flash firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt flash_usb
```
